/**
 * Shared read-model types for the dashboard query layer (SSOT).
 *
 * These are the shapes the dashboard routes consume — NOT the raw Drizzle row
 * shapes. A query function reads from the DB (possibly across joins/aggregations)
 * and returns one of these plain structs so the UI is insulated from the table
 * layout. Import these here — they are the SSOT for the dashboard read models.
 *
 * Conventions:
 * - Timestamps are ISO strings (`text` columns already store ISO; `integer`
 *   timestamp columns are serialized to ISO at the query boundary).
 * - Nullable-but-commonly-present fields use `string | null`, not `undefined`,
 *   so they survive JSON over the wire (loader data → client) losslessly.
