Cloudflare Workers AI extractor adapter for MemoFS.

## What is this?

**Cloudflare Workers AI frontier extractor adapter for MemoFS.** Implements
core's provider-neutral `Extractor` contract against a Cloudflare Workers AI
binding (`env.AI`), extracting subject–predicate–object facts into the memory
graph.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @memofs/adapter-workers-ai
```

> Requires **Node.js >= 22**.

Peer dependency: `@cloudflare/workers-types` (for the `Ai` binding type).

## Quick Start

```ts
import { createWorkersAiExtractor } from "@memofs/adapter-workers-ai";

const extractor = createWorkersAiExtractor({ ai: env.AI });

// Pass it to the MemoFS runtime:
// new MemoFS({ store, projectId, mode: "local", extractor, ... })
```

## Resilience

The adapter parses the model's output **defensively**: malformed JSON, missing
fields, or unknown relation types are dropped (never thrown). A failed
extraction returns an empty `{ nodes, edges }`, so the write fan-out stays
resilient — and the rule-based extractor remains available as the fallback when
no `Ai` binding is configured.

## Boundary

This package owns the Workers AI extractor adapter implementation. It does not
own the MemoFS core `Extractor` contract, other adapters, or the Workers AI
service itself.
